/**
 * @class AStar
 * AStar defines the basic data structures to implement A* or
 * ARA* (Anytime Repairing A*) based search algorithms.
 *
 * The A* algorithm is optimal (that is, it finds the solution with the lowest
 * cost) under the condition of using an admissible heuristic.
 * Consistent (monotonic) heuristics are not required, as
 * this implementation does not use a closed set -- a Node which has already been
 * expanded can be expanded again in case a less costly path is found which leads to it.
